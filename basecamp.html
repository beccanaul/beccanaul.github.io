						<h2>Howdy, Basecamp</h2>
						<p>My name is Becca Naul. I'm a designer living in Austin, Texas. I'd like to take this opportunity to show you who I am, what I’ve done, and why I am applying for this position as Product Designer. </p>

						<h2>Don Draper Dreams</h2>
						<p>I started The University of Texas' Advertising portfolio program a few months before AMC's Mad Men began to air. While the show made my parent's skeptical about my future career, I was being taught what makes a "big idea" by some amazing professors who focused on a rapidly changing world of web and non-traditional media. The Creative Sequence taught me how to think and, more importantly, listen. </p>

						<h2>Remember 2009?</h2>
						<p>That's when I graduated. It wasn't the best time for job seekers. I had a few paying offers, but fortunately, I was able to turn them down for an unpaid internship at a four person East Side design shop called <a href="http://foxtrotbravoalpha.com"> Foxtrot Bravo Alpha</a>. While I knew some photoshop and inDesign, it wasn't what I went to school for (which was terrifying) and there was and I had to work nights at a yogurt shop to get by (which was exhausting), but the people inspired and amazed me so I knew I had to give it all I had. Also I was introduced to a little program called ‘Basecamp’, which I would soon find indispensable.</p>

						<h2>Worth it.</h2>
						<p>I ended up being FBA's 5th employee a few months later. We're still only 7 full-time people, so I've been able to learn and take the lead on everything from wireframing to logo design while still getting to use my advertising background for things like persona research and pitching (a favorite of mine because it's the ultimate storytelling).  </p>

						<h2>A Creative Workflow Tool</h2>
						<a href="http:globaledit.com" style="font-size: 2em;">GLOBALEDIT.COM</a>
						<p>My most recent project to go live is a brochure site for a company who is actually very similar to you guys. Created out of necessity by a group of creative production professionals, the web app allows companies with massive amounts of photography and video to review, communicate, approve and send their assets. The problem was it required a 45 minute long phone call to explain the whole thing. Our job was to create a narrative that generated qualified leads and eliminate the need for that lengthy sales call. Working with a copywriter and developer, I did the UX and UI for this site. </p>

						<h2>But...</h2>
						<p>While I'm super proud of the site, both how it turned out and how much I learned about web animations, presenting 100% remotely and rapid prototyping with axure and html/css in the process, there are sooo many things I would do different if I knew then what I knew now (like, hello? mobile first!), but I can't. Because the contract is complete.</p>

						<h2>Which is why I made this page for you</h2>
						<p>I'm ready for some iteration! I'm ready to really get to know a passionate user base and make things that make their lives better. Most importantly, I want to be apart of a passionate and thoughtful team, which after reading 'REMOTE' is something I know you have created. </p>
						<p>Not to mention, I know I could feel proud working for you guys, especially if you keep doing things like you did on <a href="https://basecamp.com/teachers">Tuesday.</a> </p>
						<p>So if you've made it this far I'd love for you to check out my <a href="https://rebeccanaul.com">PORTFOLIO</a> and <a href="https://beccanaul.github.io/about.html">RESUME</a>. If you have any questions or would like to set up a time to skype, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:beccanaul@gmail.com?Subject=Becca%20hearts%20Basecamp!" target="_top">email me.</a>

						<h2>Howdy, ya'll</h2>
						<p>My name is Becca Naul. I'm a designer living in Austin, Texas. I'd like to take this opportunity to show you who I am, what Iâ€™ve done, and why I am applying for this position as a Product Designer with Designer Bridge. </p>

						<h2>Don Draper Dreams</h2>
						<p>I started The University of Texas' Advertising portfolio program a few months before AMC's Mad Men began to air. While the show made my parent's skeptical about my future career, I was being taught what makes a "big idea" by some amazing professors who focused on a rapidly changing world of web and non-traditional media. The Creative Sequence taught me how to think and, more importantly, listen. </p>

						<h2>Remember 2009?</h2>
						<p>That's when I graduated. It wasn't the best time for job seekers. I had a few paying offers, but fortunately, I was able to turn them down for an unpaid internship at a four person East Side design shop called <a href="http://foxtrotbravoalpha.com"> Foxtrot Bravo Alpha</a>. While I knew some photoshop and inDesign, it wasn't what I went to school for (which was terrifying) and there was and I had to work nights at a yogurt shop to get by (which was exhausting), but the people inspired and amazed me so I knew I had to give it all I had.</p>

						<h2>Worth it.</h2>
						<p>I ended up being FBA's 5th employee a few months later. We're still only 7 full-time people, so I've been able to learn and take the lead on everything from wireframing to logo design while still getting to use my advertising background for things like persona research and pitching (a favorite of mine because it's the ultimate storytelling).  </p>

						<h2>Low Cost. Big Heart</h2>
						<a href="http://emancipet.org" style="font-size: 2em;">EMANCIPET.ORG</a>
						<p>One of my favorite projects was for a local non-profit dedicated to low cost veterinary care called Emancipet. As they had been expanding from one clinic, to multiple locations + mobile units, their site had become a bit of rat's nest. </p>

						<h2>A Creative Workflow Tool</h2>
						<a href="http://globaledit.com" style="font-size: 2em;">GLOBALEDIT.COM</a>
						<p>My most recent project to go live is a site for a cloud based creative workflow tool. Created out of necessity by a group of creative production professionals, the web app allows companies with massive amounts of photography and video to review, communicate, approve and send their assets. The problem was it required a 45 minute long phone call to explain the whole thing. Our job was to create a narrative that generated qualified leads and eliminate the need for that lengthy sales call. Working with a copywriter and developer, I did the UX and UI for this site. </p>

						<h2>But...</h2>
						<p>While I'm super proud of the site, both how it turned out and how much I learned about web animations, presenting 100% remotely and rapid prototyping with axure and html/css in the process, there are sooo many things I would do different if I knew then what I knew now, as is true with every project I've done. Because the contract is complete.</p>

		<h2>January Dribbble Meetup</h2>
		<h4>January 19, 2014</h4>
		<p>I'm pretty terrible when it comes to getting off the internet and meeting people IRL. I always want to go, but after a long day of work and a mild case of social anxiety, I usually end up talking myself out of going. However, this Thursday, after some gentle nudging (forcing) by my coworkers, I ended up at the Gingerman for a dribbble meetup. And it wasn't at all terrible! In fact, it was pretty great to meet the people I follow (stalk) and see some familiar faces. </p>

		<p>Proof that I was actually having a good time: <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BeMb18LCEAAOpo4.jpg"> </p>

		<h4>Definitely looking forward to the next one :)</h4>
